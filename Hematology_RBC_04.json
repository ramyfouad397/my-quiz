    "options": ["Spherocytes", "Bite cells", "Target cells", "Sickle cells"],
    "answer": "Bite cells",
    "explanation": "In G6PD deficiency, oxidative damage produces Heinz bodies, which are removed by splenic macrophages, leaving 'bite cells.'"

  {
    "question": "What is the significance of increased red cell distribution width (RDW)?",
    "options": ["Indicates hypochromia", "Indicates anisocytosis", "Indicates poikilocytosis", "Indicates polycythemia"],
    "answer": "Indicates anisocytosis",
    "explanation": "RDW measures the variation in red blood cell size. An increased RDW suggests anisocytosis, as seen in iron deficiency anemia."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which RBC morphology is typically seen in liver disease?",
    "options": ["Target cells", "Sickle cells", "Schistocytes", "Dacrocytes"],
    "answer": "Target cells",

    "options": ["Microcytosis", "Macrocytosis", "Hypochromia", "Hemolysis"],
    "answer": "Macrocytosis",
    "explanation": "Folate deficiency impairs DNA synthesis, leading to large (macrocytic) red blood cells, often with hypersegmented neutrophils."

    "options": ["Spherocytes", "Schistocytes", "Target cells", "Sickle cells"],
    "answer": "Schistocytes",
    "explanation": "Schistocytes (fragmented RBCs) are seen in microangiopathic hemolytic anemia due to mechanical damage in small vessels."
