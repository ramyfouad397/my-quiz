    "options": ["Iron", "Calcium", "Magnesium", "Zinc"],
    "answer": "Iron",
    "explanation": "Iron in hemoglobin binds oxygen molecules for transport."

    "question": "Which disease is caused by abnormal hemoglobin leading to sickle-shaped red cells?",
    "options": ["Sickle cell anemia", "Thalassemia", "Aplastic anemia", "Iron deficiency anemia"],
    "answer": "Sickle cell anemia",
    "explanation": "Sickle cell anemia is caused by a mutation in hemoglobin, distorting red cell shape."

    "options": ["Polycythemia", "Leukopenia", "Thrombocytosis", "Anemia"],
    "answer": "Polycythemia",
    "explanation": "Polycythemia is an abnormal increase in red cell mass, which can thicken blood."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which organ removes old and damaged red blood cells?",
    "options": ["Spleen", "Liver", "Kidney", "Lungs"],
    "answer": "Spleen",
    "explanation": "The spleen filters out old or damaged red blood cells from circulation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the normal red blood cell count in adult males?",
    "options": ["4.7–6.1 million/µL", "3.0–4.0 million/µL", "6.5–8.0 million/µL", "2.0–3.0 million/µL"],

  {
    "question": "Which type of anemia is caused by iron deficiency?",
    "options": ["Microcytic anemia", "Macrocytic anemia", "Normocytic anemia", "Hemolytic anemia"],
    "answer": "Microcytic anemia",
    "explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia leads to smaller (microcytic), pale (hypochromic) red cells."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main function of carbonic anhydrase in red blood cells?",
    "options": ["Transport CO2", "Bind oxygen", "Produce hemoglobin", "Generate ATP"],
