    "options": ["HbA", "HbA2", "HbF", "HbS"],
    "answer": "HbA2",
    "explanation": "Beta-thalassemia trait shows elevated HbA2 due to underproduction of beta chains."

    "options": ["Serum iron", "TIBC", "Ferritin", "Transferrin saturation"],
    "answer": "Ferritin",
    "explanation": "Ferritin is the best marker of body iron stores; low ferritin is highly suggestive of iron deficiency."

  {
    "question": "What is the typical MCV finding in iron deficiency anemia?",
    "options": ["Microcytic", "Normocytic", "Macrocytic", "Variable"],
    "answer": "Microcytic",
    "explanation": "Iron deficiency anemia is usually microcytic (low MCV) due to reduced hemoglobin production."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which condition is characterized by an increased reticulocyte count?",
    "options": ["Aplastic anemia", "Iron deficiency anemia", "Hemolytic anemia", "Chronic kidney disease"],
    "answer": "Hemolytic anemia",
    "explanation": "Hemolysis stimulates the bone marrow to produce more reticulocytes in compensation."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main function of haptoglobin?",
    "options": ["Bind hemoglobin", "Carry iron", "Stimulate RBC production", "Prevent clotting"],
    "answer": "Bind hemoglobin",
    "explanation": "Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin released during hemolysis, preventing kidney damage and iron loss."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which blood smear finding is typical in lead poisoning?",
    "options": ["Target cells", "Basophilic stippling", "Howell-Jolly bodies", "Heinz bodies"],
    "answer": "Basophilic stippling",
    "explanation": "Basophilic stippling of RBCs is a hallmark of lead poisoning due to impaired RNA degradation."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which RBC abnormality is common in hereditary elliptocytosis?",
    "options": ["Elliptocytes", "Spherocytes", "Target cells", "Bite cells"],
    "answer": "Elliptocytes",
    "explanation": "Hereditary elliptocytosis is caused by mutations in cytoskeletal proteins, leading to elliptical RBCs."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the main cause of anemia in chronic kidney disease?",
    "options": ["Iron deficiency", "Vitamin B12 deficiency", "Low erythropoietin production", "Bone marrow failure"],
    "answer": "Low erythropoietin production",
    "explanation": "Kidneys produce erythropoietin, which stimulates RBC production; its deficiency causes anemia in CKD."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which blood test measures the variability in red blood cell size?",
    "options": ["MCV", "MCH", "RDW", "MCHC"],
    "answer": "RDW",
    "explanation": "Red cell distribution width (RDW) quantifies the degree of anisocytosis (variation in RBC size)."

  {
    "question": "Which RBC inclusion is composed of denatured hemoglobin?",
    "options": ["Heinz bodies", "Howell-Jolly bodies", "Pappenheimer bodies", "Cabot rings"],
    "answer": "Heinz bodies",
