    "options": ["Vitamin B1", "Vitamin B6", "Vitamin B9 (folate)", "Vitamin C"],
    "answer": "Vitamin B9 (folate)",

    "options": ["Howell-Jolly bodies", "Basophilic stippling", "Cabot rings", "Heinz bodies"],
    "answer": "Cabot rings",
    "explanation": "Cabot rings are remnants of the mitotic spindle and are seen in megaloblastic anemia and lead poisoning."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which test best measures the average size of red blood cells?",
    "options": ["MCV", "MCH", "MCHC", "RDW"],
    "answer": "MCV",
    "explanation": "Mean corpuscular volume (MCV) indicates the average red blood cell size and helps classify anemias as microcytic, normocytic, or macrocytic."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which RBC finding is strongly associated with hereditary spherocytosis?",
    "options": ["Target cells", "Spherocytes", "Bite cells", "Elliptocytes"],
    "answer": "Spherocytes",
    "explanation": "Spherocytes are round RBCs lacking central pallor, seen in hereditary spherocytosis due to membrane protein defects."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is the function of 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) in red blood cells?",
    "options": ["Increases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen", "Decreases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen", "Synthesizes heme", "Protects against oxidative stress"],
    "answer": "Decreases hemoglobin’s affinity for oxygen",
    "explanation": "2,3-BPG binds hemoglobin and decreases its oxygen affinity, facilitating oxygen release to tissues."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which RBC shape is classically seen in severe burns?",
    "options": ["Acanthocytes", "Spherocytes", "Echinocytes", "Schistocytes"],
    "answer": "Echinocytes",
    "explanation": "Echinocytes (burr cells) can develop in severe burns, uremia, and other conditions."
  },
  {
    "question": "Which RBC inclusion is seen in asplenic patients due to impaired filtering?",
    "options": ["Heinz bodies", "Howell-Jolly bodies", "Cabot rings", "Pappenheimer bodies"],
    "answer": "Howell-Jolly bodies",
    "explanation": "Howell-Jolly bodies are nuclear remnants normally removed by the spleen; their presence indicates splenic dysfunction or absence."
  },

    "options": ["Target cells", "Spherocytes", "Elliptocytes", "Dacrocytes"],
    "answer": "Spherocytes",
    "explanation": "Autoimmune hemolysis leads to partial phagocytosis of RBC membranes, producing spherocytes."
